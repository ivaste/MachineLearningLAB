## Lab 0 - Learning the Mean of a Normal Distribution
**Notebook link:** [Lab0_StefanoIvancich_1227846](https://github.com/ivaste/MachineLearningLAB/blob/master/Lab0Material/Lab0_StefanoIvancich_1227846.ipynb)  
**Content:**
 - Generate data from a Gaussian distribution.
 - Estimate a confidence interval (CI) for the data we have.
 - Then we are going to run the experiment 100 times and see how many times our confidence interval contains the true value of the parameter.
 - Finally, we are going to see how the estimate of the mean and the CI change as we get more and more data.
