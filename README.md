## Lab 0 - Learning the Mean of a Normal Distribution
 - Generate data from a Gaussian distribution.
 - Estimate a confidence interval (CI) for the data we have.
 - Then we are going to run the experiment 100 times and see how many times our confidence interval contains the true value of the parameter.
 - Finally, we are going to see how the estimate of the mean and the CI change as we get more and more data.
